## Lesson: 2026-02-20
**Mistake**: Sidebar showed import time rather than actual ticket creation time.
**Root cause**: `created_at` in `tickets_processed` was populated via DB default/current timestamp during ingestion; list ordering also used `last_updated_at`.
**Rule**: For timeline UI fields, always validate timestamp provenance end-to-end (source extraction -> persistence -> API ordering -> display).
**Pattern**: Any ticket timeline/card/time sort feature must avoid ingestion timestamps unless explicitly requested.

## Lesson: 2026-02-20 (navigation persistence)
**Mistake**: Sidebar UI context (active filter + list position) was lost after selecting a ticket.
**Root cause**: Component-local state was not persisted across route remounts; navigation used default scroll behavior.
**Rule**: For list-detail navigation, persist list UI state (filter/sort/scroll) across route transitions and disable auto-scroll jumps where appropriate.
**Pattern**: Any sidebar/list that navigates to detail routes must retain user context to avoid disorientation.

## Lesson: 2026-02-20 (blink on ticket switch)
**Mistake**: Previous fix preserved sidebar state but still navigated between dynamic routes, so full UI remounted and blinked.
**Root cause**: Persistence of scroll/filter alone does not prevent remount; route transition in `/triage/[id]` remained.
**Rule**: For master-detail ticket navigation, if smooth switching is required, avoid route remount on every selection and switch detail state in-place.
**Pattern**: Use state-driven detail selection + URL sync (`history.replaceState`) when UI continuity is higher priority than route-level remount behavior.

## Lesson: 2026-02-20 (card readability)
**Mistake**: Card layout hid too much of subject and split context into less useful rows.
**Root cause**: Single-line subject truncation and non-optimal information hierarchy.
**Rule**: In compact ticket cards, prioritize subject readability with 2-line clamp and group secondary metadata in one compact row.
**Pattern**: Time on left + org/requester on right improves scanability without increasing card height too much.

## Lesson: 2026-02-20 (title vs description boundary)
**Mistake**: Card sometimes displayed `Title + Description` concatenated as title.
**Root cause**: Parser title regex stopped at newline only, but some templates place `Description:` on same line/HTML flow.
**Rule**: Parse structured email fields with explicit marker boundaries, not only newline boundaries.
**Pattern**: `Title` extraction must stop at next known marker (`Description`, `Created by`, etc.).
